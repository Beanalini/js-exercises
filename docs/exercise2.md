# Exercise 2

Once again we have a selection of JavaScript challenges for you to work through.

1. Take a look over your _indentation_ for the previous challenges. Does everything look neat and consistent? If you right click inside your files and select **Format Document**, does VSCode make any adjustments? If so, `add` and `commit` these changes.

2. Work through the challenges in the `challenges/exercise2.js` file, adding and committing your work as you go.

Once you have completed these challenges you can move onto the next ones: [Exercise 3 - Docs](./exercise3.md)

You're doing great! ðŸ™Œ
